Here are my solutions to <ins>some</ins> of the algorithmic problems I found on the [Kattis Problem Archive](https://open.kattis.com).

I'm actually one of the top 15 [highest-ranked Kattis problem solvers in my country](https://open.kattis.com/countries/GRC)! But to be honest, that isn't impressive at all, there are only 90 Kattis users in my country, and I only had to solve a few easy problems to rank in the top 15. Oh well.

My solutions are coded differently compared to way I normally code (I further explain this [here](https://github.com/numdar335/programming_contests/blob/master/note.md)).

Uhh I also have to point out that most of my code here is **far** from optimal in terms of formatting and tweaking, and I feel really insecure about it but then again I don't really want to fix it, it is **a lot** of code after all.
